## This is a simple template to practice some Frontend skills using SCSS files, and also using CSS Grid and Flexbox 

#### What I did / What I learned: 
* Used functions within SASS to manage text color managment and opacity
* I build also media query for Screen size  under 700px
* Used the grid system to layout components in pages
* Modify the grid template declarations on media query

#### How to download and use: 

* Create a directory in your local machine
* Run `git clone` project remote URL 
* Once it's in your local, you need to use 'live server extension' and 'watch SASS' extension (VS Code Editor)
* or: Run a SASS compiler of your preference
